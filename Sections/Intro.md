# Introduction

Most educators, regardless of their discipline, will agree with the claim that teaching students *critical thinking* is of the utmost importance. 

One of the main reasons behind this agreement is, probably, the belief that a formal course in critical thinking can make students better thinkers. 

However, whether that is the case or not is far from obvious. The claim that critical thinking (CRT) is not a domain-independent set of skills has been made [before](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/AEPR.109.4.21-32). Critics argue that the ability to think critically depends on the domain knowledge, experience and practice. If that is true, then teaching critical thinking as a standalone course detached from particular domains, is perhaps futile.

One thing is true, regardless of which side of this debate one falls: there are no data to justify any of these presumptions. There have been no large-scale studies that could confirm these claims. Recently, [philosophers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/abs/does-studying-philosophy-make-people-better-thinkers/73DCEDABFD91B2344F859F9D0DBE7772) have raised questions about the lack of evidence for similar claims. 

At BMCC, we've been teaching CRT for years and this academic year (2023/2024) we decided to collect some data to help us answer this particular question:

**Does taking a critical thinking course increase students' abilities to think critically?**

The following report is a result of this two-semester long project.
