# Data Collection

The data for this research has been collected during the Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 semesters. I used Google Forms to make a questionnaire (survey) administered to students in CRT course sections.

There were two surveys: one administered at the beginning of each semester (usually within the first two weeks) and another administered at the end (usually during the final two weeks).

Here are the surveys:

[Post-survey](../Files/Post.pdf)

## The sample

In the two semesters combined, there were **1,518** students enrolled in **105** sections of different critical thinking courses, majority of which were basic CRT-100 courses.

Out of these, **245** completed the pre-survey, while only **113** completed the post-survey.

The surveys were given to students as links to the appropriate Google Form with a short deadline to complete them (usually a week or two). They were **not mandatory**, and students could opt out (and many of them did).

The hope was that the selection of students who completed the surveys would be random, making the sample as representative as possible. However, the **self-selection** aspect raises some doubts as to whether the results really reflect our student body. It is quite possible that the sample is skewed towards more responsible students, those who took the instructors' suggestions to fill in this (non-mandatory and non-graded) survey seriously. 

Therefore, this should be borne in mind when intepreting the results.
