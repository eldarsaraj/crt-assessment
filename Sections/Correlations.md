# Correlations

Let's see first if there's any meaningful correlation between some demographic variables and the score. 

I'll plot the most interesting one, so we can see it visually. For the ones not shown here, check the Appendix 1.

First, let's look at whether there is any difference between freshmen and sophomores.

```{figure} ../Files/Charts/level.png

Scores by level (Freshman or Sophomore).

```{card}
In case you're unfamiliar with the chart type, this one is called a **box plot** (or box and whiskers plot) and it is great for summarizing visually the distribution of a certain value. The box contains the middle 50% of the data, stretching from the 25th percentile (the bottom of the box) to the 75th percentile (the top of the box). The line in the middle of the box is the **median** value. If you can't see the median, then it is either at the top or the bottom of the box (coinciding with 75th or 25th percentile).

The whiskers extend down and up from the box, from the lowest (bottom whisker) to the highest (top whisker) value. Any diamond-shaped dots represent outliers, values far away from the median (extremely low or extremely high scores).
```

In terms of student level, we see that both freshmen and sophomores have seen improvement in the score (the median is higher in the post survey box), but that there is more variance in the sophomore group (the box is longer).

Let's see gender now:

height: 300px

Scores by gender.
```
We can see here that the male students improved more in the post survey than the female students. 

Here's one more, this time scores by age:

```{figure} ../Files/Charts/age2.png
---
height: 300px
name: age2
---
Scores by age.
```
The biggest difference in improvement here can be seen in the 31-40 age group. 

While we can notice some interesting correlations, I don't think we can conclude much from them at this point, so the purpose

I'll finish the report by discussing the limitations of this kind of research and proposing a few possible steps in the future.
