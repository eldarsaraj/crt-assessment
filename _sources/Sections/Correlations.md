# Correlations

I'll plot the most interesting correlations, so we can see them visually. For the ones not shown here, check Appendix 1.

First, let's look at whether there is any difference in scores between freshmen and sophomores.

Scores by level (freshman or sophomore).

```{card}
In case you're unfamiliar with the chart type, this one is called a **box plot** (or box and whiskers plot) and it is great for summarizing visually the distribution of a certain value. The box contains the middle 50% of the data, stretching from the 25th percentile (the bottom of the box) to the 75th percentile (the top of the box). The line in the middle of the box is the **median** value. If you can't see the median, then it is either at the top or the bottom of the box (coinciding with 75th or 25th percentile).

The whiskers extend down and up from the box, from the lowest (bottom whisker) to the highest (top whisker) value. Any diamond-shaped dots represent outliers, values far away from the median (extremely low or extremely high scores).
```

In terms of student level, we see that both freshmen and sophomores have seen improvement in the score (the median is higher in the post survey box), but that there is more variance in the sophomore group (the box is longer).

Let's see gender now:

```{figure} ../Files/Charts/gender.png

height: 300px

Scores by gender.
```
We can see here that the male students improved more in the post survey than the female students. Two female students had an extremely low score (it's quite possible that they haven't answered all the questions). There was only one non-binary student, who improved the score in the post-survey (indicated by two horizontal lines in the right part of the chart).

This one is quite surprising to me. My in-class experience in the past several years would tell me that female students are better (at least the ones taking my course) overall, but I guess that may not be true. I'd like to see more data about this, definitely.

Here's one more, this time scores by age:

```{figure} ../Files/Charts/age2.png

height: 300px
name: age2

Scores by age.
```
The biggest difference in improvement here can be seen in the < 20, 31-40 and 41+ age group. I don't know how to interpret this, honestly. I did notice that older students are usually more responsible and, perhaps that explains the result here, but it could be the case that the small number of older students here is not representative enough.

While we can notice some interesting correlations, I don't think we can conclude much from them at this point. At least, they may serve as points of departure for a discussion about the improvement of this study.

I'll finish the report by discussing the limitations of this kind of research and proposing a few possible steps in the future.
